The booking.com interface for hosts is confusing, to put it mildly. 
We used Airbnb for the first 7 years since we startet our small short termin retantal business. 

But we see that the competition in our home town Koblenz is getting much tougher. So we decided to also list on booking.com

  While the Airbnb host experience is also quite quirky since they tend to change things up in the interface all the time, it's relatively easy to manage our properties.

  Anyways, I wanted to share some tips for booking.com where I did not find any helpful articles.

  Lately we wanted to sync calendars between booking.com and Airbnb. I found this artice from booking https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/help/rates-availability/extranet-calendar/syncing-your-bookingcom-calendar-third-party-calendars

But I could not find the menu item for syncing the calendars described in the article.

One of the main problems with the booking.com interface is the not very user friendly concept of just not showing settings or configuration if they are not possible because of other configuration settings. 
  
  A better way woudld be to show all configurations options but disabeling them if they are not possible but giving the user a hint which other configuration setting blocks the item.

  Anyways here is what I had to do.. I cklicked through ALL menu items in the booking.com admin backend. The clue came from the following paragraph in the article:


  '''
Calendar syncing is not available for all property types. To import or export calendars, your property needs to have 20 room types or less, and a maximum of one unit per room type. Your property also canâ€™t use XML connectivity services like property management systems or channel managers.
  '''


  I had to go to "property"
  Property Layout (very intuitive :D )
And change "Number of apartments (of this type)" to 1


  Hope this saves someone a bit of time and nerves.
