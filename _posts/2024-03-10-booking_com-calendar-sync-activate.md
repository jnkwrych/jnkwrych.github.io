Recently, I embarked on the journey to **sync my calendars between Booking.com and Airbnb**, a task many hosts face. While exploring solutions, I discovered [this article](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/help/rates-availability/extranet-calendar/syncing-your-bookingcom-calendar-third-party-calendars) on Booking.com, but encountered a challengeâ€”I couldn't locate the syncing option as mentioned.

The article highlighted a crucial point: **calendar syncing is limited** to properties with up to 20 room types and just one unit per room type. Additionally, properties connected through XML services, such as property management systems or channel managers, are ineligible.

Realizing my setup might be incorrect, I dove into the Booking.com admin backend, a maze of menus and options. After much exploration, I found the elusive setting critical for enabling the sync.

## Here's how I resolved it

> Navigate to **Property** > **Property Layout** (not *exactly* intuitive), and set the **Number of apartments (of this type)** to **1**.

This insight could be a real time-saver for many, sparing you both time and frustration.

Furthermore, if you're looking to **integrate your Airbnb and Booking.com calendars**, Airbnb offers a [helpful guide](https://www.airbnb.de/help/article/99) on retrieving your listing's calendar link and enabling two-way synchronization.
