Recently, I was trying to sync my calendars between Booking.com and Airbnb. During my search, I stumbled upon [this article](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/help/rates-availability/extranet-calendar/syncing-your-bookingcom-calendar-third-party-calendars) from Booking.com. However, when I tried to follow the steps outlined, I hit a snag—I couldn't find the mentioned menu option for syncing the calendars.

The article explains that calendar syncing isn't available for all types of properties. Specifically, your property must have 20 or fewer room types and only one unit per room type. Moreover, it can't be using XML connectivity services like property management systems or channel managers.

It dawned on me that I might have accidentally set up our listing to indicate we have more than one unit per room type. The real challenge was locating this specific setting, as it wasn't exactly straightforward. I navigated through most of the menu items and pages on the Booking.com admin backend before finally uncovering the necessary setting to enable calendar sync.

Here's the step that did the trick:
´´´
Navigate to **Property** > **Property Layout** (yes, very intuitive :D), then adjust the **Number of apartments (of this type)** to **1**
´´´

I hope sharing my experience saves you some time and frustration.

For those interested in integrating their Airbnb and Booking.com calendars, here's the [guide from Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.de/help/article/99) on obtaining your Airbnb listing's calendar link and setting up two-way syncing between Airbnb and Booking calendars.
