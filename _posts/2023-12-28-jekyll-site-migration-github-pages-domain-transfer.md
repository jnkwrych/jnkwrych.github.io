title: Insights on Jekyll Site Migration and GitHub Pages Domain Transfer
---

Navigating the complexities of website development often means adapting to changes and resolving technical challenges. I run this website since almost 10 years on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and I am still very happy with the setup. I wrote about it [here](https://jannikweyrich.com/blog/2014/01/28/this-blog-now-runs-on-github-powered-by-jekyll.html). However recently I had to **migrate my Jekyll site to a new GitHub account**, which was a tad painful, but provided valuable insights into this process. This post aims to share those learnings, focusing on aspects like **updating a Jekyll website with Bootstrap** and the nuances of **GitHub Pages domain transfer**.

## Overcoming Access Issues on GitHub Pages

The journey began with an unexpected challenge: being locked out of my GitHub Pages access. This led me to explore various solutions for **resolving GitHub Pages access issues**. The most effective solution was **cloning and transferring the GitHub repository**. This was a crucial step to regain control and implement the necessary updates on my website. For more information about GitHub Pages, visit their [official page](https://pages.github.com/). If you are not familiar with GH Pages it's free and super stable.

## Embracing Updates with Bootstrap

An integral part of the update process was integrating the latest version of Bootstrap. This step was important not only for the aesthetic enhancement of the site but also for ensuring responsiveness across different devices. You can find more about Bootstrap and its features on the [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/). The migration von Boostrap 3 to 5 was surprisingly pretty quick without major braking changes.

## The Domain Transfer Process on GitHub

A key aspect of this migration was the **custom domain setup on GitHub Pages**. Guided by **GitHub's domain transfer tutorial**, I learned about the **GitHub Pages 7-day domain release period**, a mandatory waiting period for the domain to be released and linked to a new repository. This waiting period, while initially unexpected, turned out to be true. 

## A crucial aspect I discovered was the GitHub Pages 7-day domain release period**. This period is a waiting time mandated by GitHub for the domain to be released and available for use in the new repository. Despite initial skepticism, **I found this information to be accurate, and exactly seven days after completing the domain validation**, I was able to integrate it into my new site.

For more details on this process, GitHub's guide on [configuring a custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) is a helpful resource.

## Reflecting on the Migration Experience

This experience was more than a technical task; it was a journey of learning and adaptation. Whether you're tackling **recovering locked GitHub Pages access** or searching for a **Jekyll website migration guide**, this journey highlights the importance of patience and thorough planning in digital projects.

If you are embarking on a similar path, remember that each challenge offers a chance to enhance your skills in the digital domain. Patience and diligence are crucial for successfully navigating and overcoming these challenges.
