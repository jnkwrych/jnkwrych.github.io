### About Me

I'm an entrepreneur passionate about leveraging technology to streamline business operations, with a focus on B2B software solutions. My expertise in Product Management and Strategy is grounded in a strong blend of business savvy and technical know-how, thanks to my academic background in Business and Computer Science, and hands-on experience from various client engagements and my own entrepreneurial ventures.

I was raised in a [small town](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfersheim) in the South-West of Germany. After my studies in Koblenz I settled there but traveling is a big passion of mine, especially with my wife, our two daughters and son in tow. My favorite destinations are bustling Southeast Asia and the beautiful landscapes of South Africa.

To keep the balance, you'll find me hitting the weights at a gym or occasionally on a skateboard.
